# devops_training
Repo to learn how to set up a CI/CD pipeline
For this, I am using an Arduino UNO board and PlatformIO extension
In the process, I set up a YAML file and develop the architecture, code and test cases to create an automatised building process
This is a complementary training repository to my main Computing Science learning repo - https://github.com/gidoate/cs_learning
